Assuming two valid value for offer_type
FLATX = FLAT x amount off
FLATXP = FLAT x% off.
Taking two cases for same Restaurant with ID as 1
{“restaurant_id”:1,”offer_type”: “FLATX”, “offer_value”:10, “customer_segment”:[“p1”]} ---- > for P1 offer will be FLAT x amount off
{“restaurant_id”:1,”offer_type”: “FLATXP”, “offer_value”:10, “customer_segment”:[“p2”,"p3"]} ---- > for P2,P3 offer will be FLAT x % off
